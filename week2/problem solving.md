# Problem-Solving in Python

## Introduction

Problem-solving is an essential skill for any programmer. Today, we'll explore how to apply problem-solving techniques to write effective Python code.

* Understand the problem
* Break the problem down
* Develop a plan
* Implement the plan
* Test the code
* Refine the code
* Document the code

### sample Problem
**Problem**: Find the Largest and Smallest Numbers

**Task**:
Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a series of numbers and then finds the largest and smallest numbers among those entered.

**Input Format**:
The program will prompt the user to enter the numbers separated by a comma.

**Output Format**:
The program will display the largest and smallest numbers entered by the user.

### Understanding the Problem

Before we start writing code, it's important to understand the problem we're trying to solve. This involves reading the problem statement carefully, asking questions, and clarifying any ambiguities. Here are some tips:

Read the problem statement multiple times to make sure you understand it.
Identify the inputs, outputs, and any constraints.
If the problem involves data structures or algorithms, make sure you understand them.
If the problem is too complex, break it down into smaller, more manageable parts.

### Developing a Plan
Once we understand the problem, we need to develop a plan for solving it. This involves breaking the problem down into smaller, more manageable parts and developing a high-level description of the steps needed to solve the problem. Here are some tips:

### Break the problem down into smaller parts.
Develop a high-level plan that describes the steps needed to solve the problem.
Use pseudocode or flowcharts to develop the plan.
Review the plan to make sure it's complete and accurate.

### Implementing the Plan
Now it's time to translate the plan into code. This involves writing the actual code to solve the problem. Here are some tips:

Write a rough draft of the code, without worrying too much about the details.
Refine the code as you go along.
Use meaningful variable names and comments to make the code easy to understand.
Test the code as you write it to make sure it works as expected.

### Testing the Code
Once the code is written, it's important to test it thoroughly to make sure it works as expected. This involves testing the code with different inputs and edge cases. Here are some tips:

Test the code with a variety of inputs, including valid and invalid inputs.
Test the code with edge cases to make sure it handles unexpected inputs correctly.
Use automated testing tools to make testing easier.
### Refining the Code
Based on the testing, we may need to refine the code to fix any bugs or improve its performance. Here are some tips:

Use debugging tools and techniques to identify and fix any issues.
Optimize the code if needed to improve its performance.
Refactor the code to make it more readable and maintainable.

### Documenting the Code
Finally, it's important to document the code to make it easy for others (and our future selves!) to understand and use. This involves writing clear, concise comments that explain what the code does, how it works, and any assumptions or limitations. Here are some tips:

Write comments that explain the purpose of the code and how it works.
Use meaningful variable names to make the code self-documenting.
Write docstrings to document functions and classes.
Update the documentation as needed to keep it accurate and up-to-date.
Conclusion
Problem-solving is a critical skill for any programmer, and applying problem-solving techniques to Python can help us write more effective and efficient code. By following these tips and techniques, we can develop robust and maintainable code that solves complex problems.

```python
numbers = input("Enter a series of numbers separated by a comma: ")
number_list = [float(num) for num in numbers.split(",")]

if len(number_list) > 0:
    smallest = min(number_list)
    largest = max(number_list)
    print("Smallest number:", smallest)
    print("Largest number:", largest)
else:
    print("No numbers entered.")

```
